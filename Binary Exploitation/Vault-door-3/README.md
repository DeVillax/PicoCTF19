# Vault-door-3

## Description

This vault uses for-loops and byte arrays. The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor3.java

## Hints

Make a table that contains each value of the loop variables and the corresponding buffer index that it writes to.

## Approach

The provided file is a java code that checks whether the user enters the correct password to access the flag. In this case, the password corresponds to the flag itself so finding it will grant us access to higher challenges.

Let's analyze the code a little bit.

Line 9: It extracts the password/flag the user provided within the {} brackets.
Line 10: It checks the password using the checkPassword() function.

As its own name indicates the CheckPassword function checks whether the supplied password is valid. I image the challenge was thought to be resolved by manual reordering however you can simply execute the checkPassword function on a separate terminal to get the flag.

In this scenario, I used an online java compiler available at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php. I paste the checkPassword function and entered the password `jU5t_a_sna_3lpm11ga4e_u_4_m9rf48`.

This in turns get reordered to `jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_e9af18`, thus revealing the flag `picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_e9af18}`
