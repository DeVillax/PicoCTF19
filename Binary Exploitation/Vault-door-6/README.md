# Vault-door-6

## Description

This vault uses an XOR encryption scheme. The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor6.java

## Hints

If X ^ Y = Z, then Z ^ Y = X. Write a program that decrypts the flag based on this fact.

## Approach

The description indicates the program uses an XOR encryption scheme. By having a look into the code we can see a XOR operation taking place
to check the validity of the password entered:

```if (((passBytes[i] ^ 0x55) - myBytes[i]) != 0) {
                return false;
            }
```

Let's analyze what this 'if' statement within the 'for' loop does. It performs a XOR operation between each byte within the passBytes whose result is then substracted by the corresponding value within myBytes indicated by the `i` variable.
We could express this as a first grade equation. To examplize this, let's assume i = 0:

`(X ^ 0x55) - 0x3b = 0` being X the byte of the password we are looking for

Operating this we have:

`X = 0x3b ^ 0x55`. 

As doing this manually would be a really tedious task, I decided to code a simple python script that would do all this work for us.

The result of it shows the flag is `picoCTF{n0t_mUcH_h4rD3r_tH4n_x0r_0c3a2de}`
