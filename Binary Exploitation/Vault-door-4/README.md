# Vault-door-4

## Description

This vault uses ASCII encoding for the password. The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor4.java

## Hints

- Use a search engine to find an "ASCII table".
- You will also need to know the difference between octal, decimal, and hexademical numbers.

## Points

## Approach

The description indicates the program is using ASCII encoding and considering the myBytes array within the code, we probably need to
look up those values in an ASCII table. The values to convert are as follow:

```byte[] myBytes = {
            106 , 85  , 53  , 116 , 95  , 52  , 95  , 98  ,
            0x55, 0x6e, 0x43, 0x68, 0x5f, 0x30, 0x66, 0x5f,
            0142, 0131, 0164, 063 , 0163, 0137, 067 , 0141,
            '1' , 'c' , '8' , 'c' , '6' , '6' , '8' , 'b' ,
        };
 ```

Selecting one of the multiples tables available online. We start the converting process.

### First row --> Decimal

106 = j

85 = U

53 = 5

116 = t

95 = _

52 = 4

95 = _

98 = b

### Second row --> hexadecimal

0x55 = U

0x6e = n 

0x43 = C 

0x68 = h 

0x5f = _ 

0x30 = 0

0x66 = f 

0x5f = _

### Third row --> Octal

0142 = b

0131 = Y 

0164 = t 

063 = 3 

0163 = s 

0137 = _ 

067 = 7 

0141 = a

### Fourth row --> ASCII

No need to convert anything in this one.

Finally, putting all this in the CTF format we have `picoCTF{jU5t_4_bUnCh_0f_bYt3s_7a1c8c668b}`
