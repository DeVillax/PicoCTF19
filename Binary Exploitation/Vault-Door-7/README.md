# Vault-Door-7

## Description

This vault uses bit shifts to convert a password string into an array of integers. Hurry, agent, we are running out of time to stop Dr. Evil's nefarious plans! The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor7.java

## Hints

- Use a decimal/hexademical converter such as this one: https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html
- You will also need to consult an ASCII table such as this one: https://www.asciitable.com/

## Points

## Approach

Having a look into the code we realize the checkPassword function checks whether the values of the array obtained in the passwordToIntArray is equal to the following:

```
x[0] == 1096770097
&& x[1] == 1952395366
&& x[2] == 1600270708
&& x[3] == 1601398833
&& x[4] == 1716808014
&& x[5] == 1734304870
&& x[6] == 895891557
&& x[7] == 1681142832;
``` 

Having into account the explanation in the code's comment, what we need to do is to convert the values from in to hexadecimal to then convert them to its corresponding ASCII characters. In order to do that, you could use one of the multiple tools online. However, I
took a different approach by coding a simple python script to convert this for me. Please find it attached as 'Solution.py'.

This will perform the operations for us, thus giving us access to the flag `picoCTF{A_b1t_0f_b1t_sh1fTiNg_df5f8ed440}`
