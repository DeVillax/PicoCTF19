# Unzip

## Description

Can you unzip this file and get the flag?

## Approach

This challenge is not really that hard. We simply have to download the file and unzip it. I image the idea here is to unzip it using Linux commands so that we learn about them. To do this, we can use:

    unzip flag.zip

Now we just need to open the image to get the flag.

Alternatively, we can simply right click on the file and unzip it from the menu.
