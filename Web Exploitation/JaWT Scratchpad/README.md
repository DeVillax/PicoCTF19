## Approach
Let's head to the website and check what it contains. 

There is a line that instantly catch our attention: *You will need to log in to access the JaWT scratchpad. You can use any name, other than admin... because the admin user gets a special scratchpad!* 

If we try to log in as admin, we get the following message: *YOU CANNOT LOGIN AS THE ADMIN! HE IS SPECIAL AND YOU ARE NOT.*

Alright, let's try intercepting the request to check whether we can get further information on how the authentication process works.
