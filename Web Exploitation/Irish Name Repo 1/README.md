# Irish Name Repo 1

## Description

There is a website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47253/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:47253. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Hints

- There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
- Try to think about how does the website verify your login?

## Approach

Navigating to the site we see a lot of pictures of Irish actors. The challenge asks us to log in so let's start by finding a login portal.

Alright, it seems there is login portal at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47253/login.html. Let's try a random set of credentials to check what the result is.

A wild error message appears (as expected). Ok, let's try intercepting the request in Burp.

Aha, there is a debug parameter being sent, let's set it to 1.

Interesting. We can see a SQL query 

    SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='' AND password=''

By the looks of this it seems the challenge is about SQL injection. Let's try a basic SQLi:

    SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='' OR 1=1 --' AND password=''

Done! We have the flag: `picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_93e76603}`
