## Description

Can you find the robots? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:4159

## Approach

The title of the exercise gives a massive hint on where to start looking. Robots reference a file placed in web servers to 
avoid web crawlers index certain parts of the site.

We can simply browse to `/robots.txt`to access this file.

By the look of it, it seems they have defined a page they want to keep hidden `/a44f7.html`. Let's navigate to it to see what it contains.

Yaay! We have the flag. `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_a44f7}`
