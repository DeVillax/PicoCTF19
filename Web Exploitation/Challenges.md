## Description

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/11196/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:11196

## Approach

Firstly, navigate to the website to check what it contains.

Page mention us to inspect it. The "How" section show us the technologies the owner used to create the site. Let's inspect the sourcecode. 

We can see in it what it seems the first part of the flag: `<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->`
Having into account the aforementioned technologies, it wouln't surprise me if we need to look into CSS and JS files.

Accessing the mycss.css file we can see the second part of the flag1: `/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */`

The last part resides in the myjs.js file: `/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?9df7e69a} */`

If we put these parts all together we get: `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?9df7e69a}`
