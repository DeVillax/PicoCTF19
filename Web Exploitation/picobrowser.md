## Description

This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32205/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32205

## Approach

Having the title into account, my first though is to intercept the request and then change some headers to make the server believe we are using the Pico browser. Firstly, let's navigate to the page.

Ok, there is a button here. Let's click it to see what we get. It seems it tells us information about the browser we are using. If we intercept that request and change the value of the `User-agent` header to
`picobrowser`, we will get the flag!

Amazing! Here we have the flag: `picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_ee951878}`
